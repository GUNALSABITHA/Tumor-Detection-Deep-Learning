# Brain Tumor Detection Web Application

This project is a web application that uses a machine learning model to predict whether an image shows signs of a brain tumor. The application is built using Flask and Keras.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `/models`: This directory contains the code for the deep learning model used for prediction.
- `/templates`: This directory contains the HTML templates used by the Flask application.
- `/uploads`: This directory is used to store images uploaded by the user at runtime.
- `app.py`: This is the main Flask application file.
- `Pipfile`: This file contains the Python environment required to run the application.
